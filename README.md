# Pinterest Data Pipeline
Every day Pinterest runs thousands of experiments to determine what features to implement to improve the experience for their 450 million users and drive business value. These include image uploads and image clicks that will need to be processed to inform the decisions that they will make. This can be achieved with a reliable and scalable data pipeline, which i will be attempting to replicate in this project. I will be implementing a lambda architecture which will run two separate pipelines for both batch processing and real time streaming processing.using different techstacks. Batch processing provides a comprehensive and accurate view of historical data whereas the streaming pipeline will provide real time streaming processing to provide views of recent data.
